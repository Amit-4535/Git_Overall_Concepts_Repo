cherry picking


This cherry picking operations useful for copying the particular single commit from one branch to the another branch.

example --> let us say i have master and the develop brach, and i am having multiple commits in those branches..

now the use case is, i dont want to merge all the changes which is in develop branch to the master branch, instead i want to copy the single commit from develop branch to the mmaster branch.

now i need to switch to the develop branch by command --> git checkout develop 
copy the commit id, which you want to be a part of the other branch like master. (now the commitID is copied)
now go back again to the master branch and use the command --> git checkout master

and for cherry-pick use the command --> git cherry-pick commitID
(paste your commit id here)


by this way we can copy a single commit from one branch to another branch instead of merging or rebasing.
