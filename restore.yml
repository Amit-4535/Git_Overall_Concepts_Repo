git restore


git restore is a modern Git command introduced to simplify undoing changes in your working directory or staging area.

Example 1  let us say you are working on mywork file and you added some changes and added this file.. now again edited this file and added another changes  now the requirement is I need an earlier data not the new one  then in this case I can use below operation to undo the changes 


Git restore filename 

 it will provide you the earlier data.. 


(after git add and committing you can not restore the data in that file)


so for retriving the earlier data you need to perform this operation before

git add and the git commit operations..
