git clone

The git clone operation basically used to clone the exact copy of the repository. from the remote branch to the local branch.


command --  git clone repository_url

(this command will clone exact copy of the remote repository on to your local repository...)





git fetch 

The git fetch operation basically pull the changes from the remote repository to the local repository.
git fetch will pull all the recent and modified changes to your local repository, but you can not see the changes until you are not merging them to the current branch.
here the merge operation is silent, we need to perform this and then only checnges will be visible to us..

so we required basically 2 commands here.

git fetch  &&

git merge origin/branchname




git pull 

the git pull operation we can use to pull the changes from the remote repository..
in the pull operation the merge option is not silent, that means automatically merging is enabled here, not like the fetch, (in fetch we are performing the merging operation), but in the pull operation we do not need to perform the merge operation here, bydefault this option is enabled.

so we required only one command.

it basically the git pull = git fetch + git merge

git pull origin branchname

or just the

git pull



git push

the git push operation we are performing when we want to move/push all the files from our local repository to the remote repository.. so basically pushing the changes we are performing the push operation here.

command -- git push origin branchname

or just the 

git push
