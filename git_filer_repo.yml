git filter-repo


git filter-repo is a Git tool that helps you rewrite Git history — safely and efficiently.
It replaces the older git filter-branch and BFG Repo-Cleaner.


You use it when you want to:

🚫 Remove sensitive data (like passwords or API keys) from your Git history

🧹 Remove large files to reduce repo size

🏷 Rename folders or move files in all commits

👤 Change commit authorship across all commits

📂 Split or merge repositories



Install pipx (if not installed)

sudo apt update
sudo apt install pipx -y
pipx ensurepath


check the version of the python.
python3 --version



install the pipx by the command 
sudo apt install pipx -y

now install the git filter-repo


Add pipx and git-filter-repo to PATH

Since it’s installed in /root/.local/bin, run this:
  export PATH="$PATH:/root/.local/bin"


  To make this permanent (so it works even after reboot), add it to your shell config:
    echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/root/.local/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc


verify installations
git filter-repo --version
