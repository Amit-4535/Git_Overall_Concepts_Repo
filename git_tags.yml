Git Tag


	A Git tag is like a label or bookmark for a specific commit.


There are two types:
1.	Lightweight Tag — like a branch that never moves
2.	Annotated Tag — saved as a full Git object with metadata (recommended for releases)


Create the tag   git tag v1.0
Tags the latest commit on your current branch.


Create Annotated tags   git tag -a v1.0 -m "Initial release version 1.0"
  -a = annotated
  -m = message (appears in tag history)


Create tags to the existing commit / earlier commits 
git tag -a v1.0.2 0abe90c -m "Tagging earlier release"


we can get all the tags which is starting with the v1  git tag -l "v1.*"

we can push the tags as well  git push origin v1.0.2

 pushing all the tags at a time   git push origin --tags

 you can delete the tags  git tag -d v1.0


 you can delete the tags on remote by   git push origin --delete v1.0
