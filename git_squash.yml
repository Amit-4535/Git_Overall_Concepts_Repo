Git Squash


To reducing the number of commits and can end up with a few commits, we can do this by the git squash operation.


Let us say I am having one feature branch and I have created 10 commits inside it, and now I feel that these much commits I don’t required then I can reduce the commit ids as well by the operations git squash..

Squashing in Git means combining multiple commits into a single one

usually done to keep the Git history clean.

It’s most commonly used in feature branches before merging into main or develop..

When to use git squash  
•  Cleaning up messy commit history (e.g., fix typo, test, final version)
•  Combining commits for better readability before a PR/merge
•  During an interactive rebase
