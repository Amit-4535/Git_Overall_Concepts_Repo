Branching Strategy


1.	main/master branch

o	Always production-ready.
o	Contains only stable, released code.
o	Every production deployment comes from main.


2.	develop branch

o	Created from main.
o	Used as the integration branch for all upcoming features.
o	Merges back into main only at the time of a release.


3.	feature/* branches

o	Created from develop.
o	Each feature/bug/task gets its own branch.
o	After the feature is complete → merged back into develop.


4.	release/* branches

o	Created from develop when you’re preparing for a release.
o	Used for final testing, bug fixes, version bump, etc.
o	After testing → merged into both main (for production) and develop (to keep it updated).


5.	hotfix/* branches

o	Created directly from main when there’s a production issue.
o	Fix is made and tested here.
o	Then merged back into both:
	main (to apply the fix in production),
	develop (to ensure the fix is also present in future releases).
