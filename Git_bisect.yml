Git Bisect 


git bisect uses binary search to find the exact commit that introduced a bug or broke something. (basically for finding the bad commit we are using the git bisect operation)

It works by, you telling Git:
•	✅ a commit where things were good
•	❌ a commit where things are bad


Then Git will automatically:
•	Check out intermediate commits
•	Ask you to mark them as good or bad
•	Narrow down the culprit commit


Lab for bisect


-	git checkout feature
-	Create and commit working code (good state)
echo "print('Salary is correct')" > salary.py
git add salary.py
git commit -m "✅ Commit 1: Working salary function"





-	Modify file - still correct
echo "# comment added" >> salary.py
git add salary.py
git commit -m "✅ Commit 2: Added comment, still works"




-	Introduce bug (Bad commit)
echo "print('Wrong Salary')" > salary.py
git add salary.py
git commit -m "❌ Commit 3: Bug introduced in salary"




-	One more commit (bug still present)
echo "# additional bad logic" >> salary.py
git add salary.py
git commit -m "❌ Commit 4: More changes with bug"




-	Now you have history in feature 
A → ✅ Commit 1: Working
B → ✅ Commit 2: Still working
C → ❌ Commit 3: Bug introduced
D → ❌ Commit 4: Still broken



  operations

-	Perform git bisect 
-	Start bisect
git bisect start


-	Mark current commit as bad (HEAD — bug is there)
git bisect bad



-	Mark oldest commit as good
git bisect good HEAD~3
Now Git will checkout a middle commit between good and bad.



-	Test the current checked-out version
Manually inspect salary.py
cat salary.py
If it says:
•  "Salary is correct" → it's good → git bisect good
•  "Wrong Salary" → it's bad → git bisect bad




Git will keep checking out middle commits and narrow it down.
Repeat Step 9 until Git prints:
<commit-id> is the first bad commit
End bisect  git bisect reset




✅ Summary
Step	Command
Start bisect	git bisect start
Mark bad commit	git bisect bad
Mark good commit	git bisect good <commit>
Mark middle commits	git bisect good or git bisect bad
Finish session	git bisect reset
