Branch Protection Rule 


We are setting an branch protection rule here because we are preventing the others to do the unwanted things in github..

GOAL: Secure GitHub Collaboration & Permissions
💡 You want to:
1.	🔒 Protect branches like main
2.	👥 Add team members or collaborators
3.	🛡️ Restrict what others can do (read-only, PR only, review mandatory, etc.)
4.	🧾 Set merge rules (e.g., require review, CI to pass)



Add collaborator or user to your github Repository 
-	Go to repo
-	Setting  collaborator
-	Select add people
-	Enter name of your user and  select add to Repository..
-	Choose there permissions 
1)	Read		 Can only view repo
2)	Write 		 Can push to non-protected branches
3)	Triage 		 Label issues/PRs, manage without write
4)	Admin		 Full access including repo settings
5)	Maintain	 Manage issues, pull requests, some settings
6)	Custom       	 Granular control


Protect the main Branch (Enforce PR-based Workflow) 

-	GitHub → Repo → Settings > Branches
-	Under Branch protection rules, click Add rule or ruleset
-	Name to the ruleset
-	Target branches  add your branches here (add those branches for which we are creating the ruleset)
-	Recommended Rules:
-	✅ Require pull request before merging	Enforce PRs
✅ Require approvals	Select min. 1 reviewer
✅ Require status checks to pass	Enforce CI (like Jenkins)
✅ Require up-to-date with base branch	Prevent merge if out of sync
⛔ Prevent force-push	Disallow git push --force
⛔ Prevent deletion	Disallow branch deletion
