git stash



You are creating stash operation when you are working on files and those files added but not committed yet..


What is git stash?
git stash temporarily saves your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged) and restores your working directory to a clean state. It’s very useful when:
•	You're in the middle of work, but need to switch branches.
•	You want to save progress without committing.
•	You want to test something else briefly, then come back.


Use command  git stash list 	 to check all available stashes

Create new stash  git stash save “mention message here” 	 new stash will be created

Apply to that stash  git stash apply stash@{3} 		 apply to this stash, so you can start work       on this operation where you left earlier..

Drop particular stash id  git stash drop stash@{0}  	 drop the particular stash id

Apply and remove the stash (most common) (apply and delete the stash)  git stash pop

Command  git stash pop stash@{0}  		 it will apply and immediately delete stash id

Stash with custom message   git stash push -m "Incomplete UI layout for dashboard"

Remove all the stashes at a time   git stash clear  	 removing all the stashes at one go..
